wallHeatFluxIncompressible
==========================

Utility originally by the forum member Eelco van Vliet, for OpenFOAM 2.1.0: http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam-post-processing/101972-wallheatflux-utility-incompressible-case.html#post368330

The following git repository further adapts the utility for OpenFOAM 2.2.x and 2.3.x, done by Bruno Santos (wyldckat@github working at [FSD blueCAPE Lda](http://www.bluecape.com.pt)): https://github.com/wyldckat/wallHeatFluxIncompressible

The code was further adapted to OpenFOAM 5.x for the blueCFD-Kernel project, for validating the heat transfer solvers.
